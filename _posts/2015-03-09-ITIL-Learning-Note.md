IT Infrastructure Library or ITIL is a framework that provides structure and best practice guidelines for implementing and maintaining IT Service Management.

## ITIL Service Life Cycle ##

The core of the ITIL framework is the ITIL Service Life Cycle. It provides a comprehensive approach to the various aspects of Service Management.

The ITIL Service Life Cycle has various components. Applying these components ensures that Service Management processes are efficient and effective. It also ensures there's a balance between a strong, stable structure and an environment that can improve and adapt to business needs.

The ITIL Service Life Cycle provides a structure that enables you to organize information and processes into an interconnected framework.

Without this structure, you would have no way of determining the relative importance of information items or the connections between them.

The ITIL Service Life Cycle also provides guidelines to help understand the structure and the connection between processes and components. It helps determine how changes in an area can affect the whole system or part of it.

You can use the structure to determine patterns of behavior that lead to the occurrence of events. Then you can control or change these events by simply changing the structure.

The ITIL Service Life Cycle contains five key stages:

- Service Strategy

	> In the Service Strategy stage, you determine the underlying principles used for developing the policies, objectives, guidelines, and processes required throughout the Service Life Cycle. You also identify business opportunities.
	> Service Strategy is a critical stage of the Service Life Cycle because the decisions made in this stage impact all subsequent stages.

- Service Design

	> Service Design is the stage in which the required service is designed and developed. The design created in this stage encompasses all aspects of the service and is based on the principles identified in the Service Strategy stage.

- Service transition

	> In the Service Transition stage, you create the framework to ensure that the designed service is effectively and efficiently implemented in the live environment.
	> This stage includes determining risks, constraints, and whether the service will meet business requirement. This ensures that actual performance matches expected performance.

- Service Operation

	> During the Service Operation stage, you perform all activities and processes required to run services effectively. The Service Operation stage ensures that the framework developed in the Service Transition stage is implemented.

- Continual Service Improvement

	> The Continual Service Improvement or CSI stage is an overarching stage for maintaining service quality. You use the CSI stage to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the processes involved in every other stage of the ITIL Service Life Cycle.



Each stage of the ITIL Service Life Cycle is represented by a volume in the ITIL Core Library. Together, these volumes provide an integrated approach to Service Management throughout the ITIL Service Life Cycle.

Each volume of the ITIL Core Library provides guidance on each of the five ITIL Service Life Cycle stages.
